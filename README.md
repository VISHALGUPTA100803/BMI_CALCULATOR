# BMI_CALCULATOR



## Getting Started

I have maked a Body Mass Index Calculator
It will be a multi screen app with simple functionality but full-on custom styling.





[Download the APK from our Releases page here](https://github.com/VISHALGUPTA100803/BMI_CALCULATOR/releases/tag/v1.0.0)

I have used


1- Flutter themes to create coherent branding.


2- Flutter Routes and Navigator


3- GestureDetector Widget


4- custom colour palettes by using hex codes


5- Dart Enums and the Ternary Operator.


6- composition vs. inheritance and the Flutter way of creating custom UI.
